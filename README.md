BTL common code library in C++ with Python and Java wrappers.

C++
---
To use with C++, simply copy the libbtl directory into your project and use any headers in the `include` directory.

Python and Java
---
To use with Python or Java, libbtl needs to compile the C++ code. Run
`./compile`
which will create `python` and `java` directories in libbtl with the corresponding language files.
The wrappers correspond one-to-one with C++ code so any functions and classes can be used under the same name.S
